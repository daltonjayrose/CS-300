**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
The projects in this course focused on the usage of various data structures and algorithms, their properties, and their efficiency. Specifically, they dealt with selecting and implementing the best data structure for a program to load, save, sort, and search for courses.  
  
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  
When approaching the problem, I considered the advantages and disadvantages of the various data structures. It is important to understand data structures because different data structures are better suited to certain tasks. Choosing an inappropriate data structure could cause performance issues. It's important to consider all factors of the problem you are trying to solve when selecting a data structure.  
  
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
When I encountered roadblocks, I looked to the documentation and internet sources to learn more about the issues I was facing and to gain a better understanding of the problem.  
  
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
Before this course, I was unfamiliar with many of the common data structures. Thanks to this course, I have a greater arsenal of tools to help me discover the solution to problems in the future. Similarly, I didn't know very much about the efficiency of the various data structures and algorithms. In the future, I'll use this knowledge to think about the performance implications of my selections when designing software.  
  
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
Writing software that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is very important. When working through a complex problem, these properties make it much easier to delve into the program and work out a solution. For example, the provided code for many of the assignments was easy to analyze and understand as the code was easy to read. Similarly, some of the code used in previous assignments was adapted and included in these projects and ultimately saved me a lot of work. In my future in software development, I will strive to write code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
